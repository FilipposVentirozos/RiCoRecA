# Cross Validation Experiments 

## About
In the paper we carried a 5-fold cross validation using PEGASUS-X and LongT5.

To reproduce the experiments, one can just run the script which creates a new Python environmnet for the experiment.

The 5-fold Cross Validation dataset are located in this folder for easiness.
